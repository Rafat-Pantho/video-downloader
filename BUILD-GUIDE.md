# 🎉 Your App is Built

## ✅ What Was Created

Your Video Downloader is now a **standalone Windows application**!

### 📦 Installation File

**Location**: `dist\Video Downloader Setup 3.0.0.exe`

**Size**: ~180 MB (includes Electron runtime)

**Type**: Windows Installer (NSIS)

## 🚀 How to Install & Use

### Option 1: Run the Installer (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the `dist` folder
2. Double-click `Video Downloader Setup 3.0.0.exe`
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Choose installation location
5. App will be installed and a desktop shortcut created
6. Launch from Desktop or Start Menu

### Option 2: Use Portable Version

The `dist\win-unpacked` folder contains a portable version:

- Navigate to `dist\win-unpacked`
- Double-click `Video Downloader.exe`
- No installation required!

## 📁 Distribution

You can now share your app in two ways:

### Share the Installer

- Single file: `Video Downloader Setup 3.0.0.exe` (~180 MB)
- Users run it to install the app
- Creates Start Menu entry and Desktop shortcut
- Can be uninstalled via Windows Settings

### Share the Portable Version

- Zip the entire `dist\win-unpacked` folder
- Users extract and run `Video Downloader.exe`
- No installation needed
- Can be run from USB drive

## 🎯 What Users Need

### ✅ Your App Includes

- Complete Electron runtime
- All Node.js dependencies
- Your application code
- UI and assets

### ⚠️ Users Must Install Separately

- **Python 3** (for yt-dlp)
- **yt-dlp** (the app will offer to install it)

The app will automatically check for yt-dlp on first run and offer to install it if missing.

## 🔧 Build Commands Reference

```bash
# Build full installer (what we just did)
npm run build

# Build unpacked version only (faster, for testing)
npm run build:dir

# Run in development mode (no build)
npm start
```

## 📦 What's in the dist Folder

## 🎨 Customizing the Build

### Change App Icon

1. Create a 256x256 PNG or ICO file
2. Save as `assets/icon.ico`
3. Rebuild: `npm run build`

### Change App Name

Edit `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-custom-name",
  "productName": "My Custom App Name"
}
```

### Change Version

Edit `package.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "3.1.0"
}
```

Then rebuild: `npm run build`

## 📝 Installer Features

Your installer includes:

✅ Custom installation directory selection
✅ Desktop shortcut creation
✅ Start Menu entry
✅ Uninstaller
✅ Windows compatibility checks
✅ Modern NSIS interface

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Test Your App

1. **Install it**: Run the installer and test the installed version
2. **Test features**: Download a video to ensure everything works
3. **Check yt-dlp**: Verify the auto-installation prompt works

### Share Your App

1. **Upload the installer** to a file sharing service
2. **Or** compress `win-unpacked` folder and share as portable version
3. **Include instructions** about Python and yt-dlp requirements

### Optional: Code Signing

For professional distribution, consider:

- Getting a code signing certificate
- Signing your .exe to avoid Windows SmartScreen warnings
- Costs ~$100-400/year from certificate authorities

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

### Icon Not Showing

- Use .ico format (256x256 minimum)
- Place in `assets/icon.ico`
- Rebuild the app

### App Too Large

- Normal! Electron apps bundle Chromium (~180 MB)
- Can't be reduced significantly
- Consider compression for distribution

### App Won't Start

- Check Windows Defender/Antivirus
- Run as Administrator
- Check if Python is installed

## 🎉 Congratulations

You now have a **professional, distributable Windows application**!
